# A platform for students to explore, buy and sell used products within the campus.

The purpose of this project is to build connectivity within the campus where students can buy or sell used products from peers instead of relying on a third party producer/consumer.

- By building an internal marketplace, students can save up to $12 for delivery, which they pay to a third-party seller/buyer.
- It also enhances the connectivity in the student community.
- It is safer and more trustworthy for students to buy/sell from peers, than from outsiders.

#### Tools: ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, JWT Web tokens, Mongoose
